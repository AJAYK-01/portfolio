    <p>I'm a fifth year student at <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> in Boston, MA studying computer science and interaction design. Thanks to Northeastern's co-op program, I've had the privelege of completing two wonderful six-month co-ops at <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">MullenLowe U.S.</a> and <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>. Currently, I'm spending my third and final co-op as a <strong>UI Engineer</strong> on the iTunes team at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple</a>.</p>

    <p>I enjoy front-end development the most because it allows me to combine the logical parts of my brain with my keen eye for design (and perfectionist tedencies). As a software engineer, my goal is always to create products that are scalable and efficient under the hood, but most importantly provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user experience.</p>

    <p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you can probably find me snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board, or traveling to a new place on my bucket list!</p>
